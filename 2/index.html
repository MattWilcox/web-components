	<h1>Local Time</h1>
	<p>This component takes a <abbr title="Universal Co-ordinated Time">UTC</abbr> timestamp and displays it in the visitors local time. It displays inline as normal text: <local-time utc-timestamp="2022-01-20T10:00:00Z" show="date-and-time"></local-time>. I can't wait for the new Temporal features of native Javascript, because this Date object and methods are really long in the tooth and rough.</p>
